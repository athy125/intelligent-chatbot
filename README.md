# Intelligent Chatbot

The Intelligent Chatbot is a Python-based chatbot system that integrates with various messaging platforms, such as Slack and Facebook Messenger. It utilizes the OpenAI API and prompts to provide intelligent and context-aware responses to user messages. The chatbot is built using the FastAPI framework for high performance and asynchronous processing. This repository serves as a starting point for developing and deploying your own intelligent chatbot on different messaging platforms.

## Key Features

- Integration with Slack and other messaging platforms
- Leveraging OpenAI API for natural language processing
